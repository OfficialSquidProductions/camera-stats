Title: The Last Light

1 EXT. COASTAL ROAD - DAWN

A battered station wagon follows the coast. The lighthouse is a pin of light in the mist.

MAYA
We should have left yesterday.

ELI
And missed all this?

2 INT. STATION WAGON - DAY

Maya unfolds an old map. A red circle marks the lighthouse.

MAYA
That's where he said he'd be.

ELI
Then that's where we go.

3 EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

The car rolls to a stop. JONAH waits at the foot of the lighthouse, holding a brass key.

JONAH
I wasn't sure you'd come.

MAYA
Neither was I.

4 INT. LIGHTHOUSE STAIRWELL - DAY

Jonah leads Maya up a winding staircase. She runs a hand along the worn stone.

JONAH
One hundred and twelve steps. Your father counted every morning.

MAYA
Of course he did.

5 INT. LANTERN ROOM - DAY

Eli opens a wooden box. Inside: a letter, a photograph, and a compass.

ELI
This has your name on it.

MAYA
Let me see.

6 EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - DUSK

Maya and Jonah sit on the seawall. The tide comes in below them.

MAYA
How long do you think he waited?

JONAH
As long as he needed to.

7 INT. LANTERN ROOM - NIGHT

Maya turns the brass key. The old mechanism wakes with a low, steady hum.

MAYA
There you are.

8 EXT. COASTAL ROAD - NIGHT

Eli closes the car door. They look back. The lighthouse sweeps across the water.

ELI
Ready?

MAYA
Now I am.
