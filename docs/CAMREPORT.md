# .camreport schema 1 alpha

`.camreport` is a proposed Camera Stats format, not an industry standard. This implementation uses an unencrypted, uncompressed ZIP with exactly `manifest.json` and `report.json`. The maximum archive size is 32 MiB. Media originals, proxies, caches and OCR models are excluded. No paths are extracted to disk during import.

Manifest: `format=org.squidproductions.camreport`, `schema=1`, random `packageID`, stable `reportID`, integer `revision`, originating `device`, `scope=full-report`, and lowercase hexadecimal `sha256` over the report.json bytes. ZIP local headers, central directory, bounds, entry names, duplicates, compression, CRCs and end record are validated. Compressed/encrypted/multi-disk archives and additional entries are unsupported and rejected.

Report: stable `id`, `revision`, project `values`, camera `defaults`, named `profile`, `positions`, ordered `entries`, `history`, `importedPackages`, and declarative `namingTemplate`. Dictionaries preserve extensible field values. Dates use Foundation's Codable numeric seconds since 2001-01-01 UTC. Entries carry stable `id`, snapshot `values`, sorted `flags`, boolean `reviewed`/`deleted`, and `created`. Report schema structures are strict: future fields that would be lost in a decode/re-encode comparison are rejected. Evolving the schema requires explicit migrations and fixture tests.

Fresh exports receive fresh package IDs. Reimporting the same package ID is a no-op. Entries with new IDs are additions. Existing IDs with different contents are conflicts; current files are never overwritten based on timestamps. Different project IDs cannot merge. Omission is never deletion; only explicit tombstones can represent removed records, and competing tombstone edits are conflicts. Full three-way merge and partial scope are intentionally unavailable in this alpha.

Checksums detect accidental corruption; they are not authenticity signatures. On-device names and role labels describe attribution and do not authenticate a person. Opening separately retains the report's project ID but uses a separate local document slot so both divergent versions survive.
